## Basic Dataset Inspection

### Load a CSV file into a DataFrame
```python
df = pd.read_csv("Diamond.csv")
```
*Meaning:* Reads data from a CSV file and stores it in a variable called `df`

### View the shape of the DataFrame (rows, columns)
```python
print(df.shape)
```
*Meaning:* `.shape` returns a tuple: (number of rows, number of columns); `df.shape[0]` means rows and `df.shape[1]` means columns

### Display data types of each column
```python
print(df.dtypes)
```
*Meaning:* `.dtypes` shows the data type (e.g., object, int64, float64) of each column

### Check for missing values
```python
print(df.isnull().sum())
```
*Meaning:* Shows the count of missing values for each column - essential to check before analysis

### Get concise summary of the DataFrame
```python
print(df.info())
```
*Meaning:* `.info()` shows column names, non-null counts, data types, and memory usage

### Show the first few rows of the DataFrame
```python
print(df.head(10))
```
*Meaning:* `.head(n)` displays the first n rows (default is 5) - useful for quick inspection

## Descriptive Statistics for Numerical Variables

### Sample size (number of observations)
```python
n_obs = len(df[['carat', 'price']])
print(f"Sample size: {n_obs}")
```
*Meaning:* Counts the total number of records in the dataset for numerical analysis

### Minimum values
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].min())
```
*Meaning:* Shows the smallest value for each numerical variable - helps identify potential outliers

### Maximum values
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].max())
```
*Meaning:* Shows the largest value for each numerical variable - helps identify potential outliers

### Sample mean (average)
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].mean())
```
*Meaning:* Calculates the arithmetic average; represents the "center of mass" of the data but can be influenced by outliers

### Sample variance
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].var(ddof=1))
```
*Meaning:* Measures the average squared deviation from the mean; `ddof=1` specifies sample variance (N-1 degrees of freedom)

### Sample standard deviation
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].std(ddof=1))
```
*Meaning:* Square root of variance; in same units as original data; higher value means data points are more spread out

### Median
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].median())
```
*Meaning:* The middle value when data is sorted; robust to outliers; better represents "typical" value in skewed distributions

### Quartiles and Quantiles
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].quantile([0.25, 0.50, 0.75]))
```
*Meaning:* Returns values at specified percentiles; Q1 (25%), Q2/median (50%), Q3 (75%); IQR = Q3-Q1 measures spread of middle 50% of data

### Skewness
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].skew())
```
*Meaning:* Measures asymmetry of distribution; >0 indicates right-skewed (long tail to right), <0 indicates left-skewed

### Kurtosis
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].kurtosis())
```
*Meaning:* Measures "peakedness" and tail heaviness; >0 indicates heavy tails (more outliers), <0 indicates light tails

## Descriptive Statistics for Categorical Variables

### Frequency tables
```python
print(df['colour'].value_counts().sort_index())
```
*Meaning:* `.value_counts()` shows how many observations fall into each category; reveals most/least common categories

### Multiple column frequency counts
```python
print(df[['colour', 'certification']].value_counts())
```
*Meaning:* Counts occurrences of unique combinations across multiple categorical columns

### Mode (most frequent value)
```python
print(df[['colour', 'clarity', 'certification']].mode().iloc[0])
```
*Meaning:* Identifies the most frequently occurring category; useful for understanding dominant categories in categorical data

---

## Bivariate Analysis

### Covariance matrix
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].cov())
```
*Meaning:* Measures how two numerical variables change together; positive = variables increase together, negative = inverse relationship; magnitude depends on units

### Correlation between two variables
```python
print(df['carat'].corr(df['price']))
```
*Meaning:* Measures strength and direction of linear relationship (-1 to 1); close to 1 = strong positive linear relationship; does not imply causation

### Correlation matrix (all numerical variables)
```python
print(df[['carat', 'price']].corr())
```
*Meaning:* Shows pairwise correlations between all numerical variables; diagonal is always 1; high off-diagonal values indicate strong linear relationships

### Contingency table (two categorical variables)
```python
print(pd.crosstab(df['colour'], df['certification']))
```
*Meaning:* Shows joint frequency distribution of two categorical variables; reveals associations between categories; large differences suggest potential relationship

## Practical Tips

1. **Always check for missing data** before performing statistical analysis
2. **Compare mean and median** - if mean > median, distribution is likely right-skewed
3. **Use median and IQR** for skewed distributions instead of mean and standard deviation
4. **Visualize your data** with histograms and box plots to complement numerical statistics
5. **Remember**: correlation does not imply causation - it only measures linear relationships
